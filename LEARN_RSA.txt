title How IT's inseparable couple \n Alice & Bob \n communicate via the RSA Cryptosystem
caption How IT's inseparable couple \n Alice & Bob \n communicate via the RSA Cryptosystem
actor Alice as A
actor Bob as B
== Key Generation ==
note over A, B
	Key generation in RSA involves the creation of a 
	public key (e) and a private key (d) for Alice and Bob
end note
hnote over A : Private key (d)\nis not shared
== Key Distribution ==
A -> B : Alice's Public Key e
== Encryption ==
note over of B
	Bob wants to send Alice a secret message M 
	that only Alice should be able to read
	So M is encrypted with Alice's public key e
end note
B -> A : e(M)
== Decryption ==
note over of A
	e(M) can only be decrypted by 
	Alice's private key d
	Hence, only Alice can read M
end note
A -> A : d(e(M)) = M
