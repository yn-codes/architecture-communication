# Software Architecture Communication Tweaks

This repository contains code to support demonstrating PlantUML text embedded within code as an Architecture communication tweak within development teams.

Mode details in the blog article @ http://y-tech.blogspot.com/2016/02/software-architecture-communication.html

A simplified RSA cryptosystem is used as an example.

# Conclusion
In summary, an architecture needs to be descriptively documented, communicated and accessible in its current version to all stakeholders as it evolves over time. As an architecture evolves, chances are that its current version as implemented and the documentations are not in sync. Keeping them in sync and enabling easy access to the latest version of the architecture to all stakeholders are challenges.

The methods described in this [blog article](http://y-tech.blogspot.com/2016/02/software-architecture-communication.html) are ways that a Software Architect can ensure that stakeholders with the responsibility to create and update architectural designs can do so easily and effectively and stakeholders who read the architecture are always provided with the latest version of the architecture. Thereby closing the gap between production and consumption of architectural designs and effectively enhancing architecture communication within the development and management organisations.
